## Description

It provides a simple example of the implementation of node child_process API as server workers using the observable pattern with RxJS.

You also can use this example as a reference for:

- To understand how to implement RxJS on server-side. ðŸš€
- To understand how to create a new node child process and communicate with them using observable pattern.
- A basic architecture to implement nestJS at enterprise-level applications.

**THIS IS A POC**. The use of `child_process nodejs` API It is not advisable to handle asynchrony queues (workers). If you need to run queues in NestJS I recommend the use of [nestjs queues](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/queues) implementation for traditional architectures or use a [microservices](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/basics) architecture based solution instead. 



## Project Structure Overview

```
    -- root
        -- src
            -- modules
                --  app
                    --  app.controller.ts // It contains the main route and service status route.
                    --  app.module.ts // Main application module.
                -- report
                    -- report.controller.ts // it contains the POST /generateMultipleIpReport controller to generate the reports.
                    -- report.module.ts
                    -- report.service.ts // it contains the worker launcher and communication. Also, it provides PROCESS_DELAY and MAX_ATTEMPTS variables configuration.
                    -- report.worker.ts // it contains the code that will be executed in the child node.
            -- main.ts // Application entry point.
```

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Testing multiple child_process feature

- If you want to change the variables for retry attempts and delay time of workers update the `report.service.ts` file under the report module.

- Run the application:

```bash
$ npm run start

```

- Open the Activity Monitor of your operative system.

- Run the following cURL instruction to make a POST call to generate a new IP report.

```bash
$ curl -d '{"ip": "8.8.8.8","reportServices": ["ipapi", "freegeoip"]}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:3000/generateMultipleIpReport

```

- Notice that for each report the system will create a new node child process to execute the task and then it will terminate the process.

```bash
$ curl -d '{"ip": "8.8.8.8","reportServices": ["ipapi", "freegeoip", "ipapi", "freegeoip", "ipapi", "freegeoip"]}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:3000/generateMultipleIpReport

```
